<h1>Install instructions</h1>
<h4>Installing on Windows Vista</h4> 
<p>Download the <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/Research/assist/Hark3/HarkSetup.exe">game installer</a>(15 megabytes) and run it.</p> 
<p><strong>Do Not</strong> install the additional voices as described for XP, these break things for reasons we don&#8217;t yet understand.</p> 
<h4>Installing on Windows XP</h4> 
<ol> 
<li>Download the <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/Research/assist/Hark3/HarkSetup.exe">game installer</a>(15 megabytes) and run it. The game should be playable at this point with the &#8220;MSSam&#8221; voices. If you have other voices installed, the should also be available. The next step installs a few more voices, if you don&#8217;t need them you can skip it.</li> 
<li>Download the <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/Research/assist/Hark3/SAPI5VoiceInstaller.msi">Microsoft Voice Installer</a>(3.5 megabytes) and run it. We have heard from some users of Netscape that simply clicking on this link results in a screen of garbled text. We recommend that you <em>right-click</em> on the link and select &#8220;Save link as&#8221; to save the file on your local disk (say on the desktop) then <em>double-click</em> on the resulting file.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>Now the game should be playable with several voices.</p>

We have heard from some users of Netscape that simply clicking on this link results in a screen of garbled text. We recommend that you <em>right-click</em> on the link and select &#8220;Save link as&#8221; to save the file on your local disk (say on the desktop) then <em>double-click</em> on the resulting file.</li> 
</ol>

<h4>Installing on Windows 98, Windows 98SE, and Windows ME</h4>

<li>On some, really old, Windows 98 machines, you may need to upgrade your DirectX version to 8.0 by downloading and running this <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/Research/assist/Hark3/DX80eng.exe">Microsoft updater</a>(10.9 megabytes).</li> 
</ol> 
<h4>Installing on Windows 95</h4>

</ol> 
<p>Unfortunately, I cannot get the Microsoft voices to work on Windows 95 so you&#8217;ll be stuck with the default &#8220;Kal&#8221; voice.</p>
