<p>Flight simulator ideas with Shane and Matthew on 12 June 2006.
<ul>
	<li>2-D only for now</li>
	<li>Forget cells, use coordinates instead, use a circular aperture for detection.</li>
	<li>Beep sound works well for targets.</li>
	<li>What sound for anti-aircraft station?</li>
	<li>Probability of getting hit while over an anti-aircraft station?</li>
	<li>Running out of fuel and/or bombs</li>
	<li>Bomb sounds?</li>
	<li>More points for hitting target than for hitting <span class="caps">AAS</span>.</li>
	<li>Possible to hit multiple targets with same sound but perhaps one target at a time is easier</li>
	<li>Have key to hear targets one at a time</li>
	<li>Multiplayer version eventually</li>
	<li>Announcements “you’ve been hit”, “you destoyed the base”, “you destroyed the <span class="caps">AAS</span>”, “targets are too far away”</li>
	<li>Warning announcement when near <span class="caps">AAS</span> and possibly continuous sound</li>
</ul></p>
