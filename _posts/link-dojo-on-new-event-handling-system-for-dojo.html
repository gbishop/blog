<p class="reader-comment">Nice event handling in Dojo 1.7 </p>

<blockquote class="reader-clip"><p>Dojo 1.7 includes a rewrite of the event handling system and introduces a new module, <code>dojo/on</code>, to provide lighter-weight, faster, more succinct, and more direct event handling. The new event system is highly optimized for mobile applications, with a lightweight footprint and cross-platform touch event normalization. While Dojo continues to provide backwards compatibility with <code>dojo.connect</code>, the <code>dojo/on</code> module eliminates much of code that is rarely used in <code>dojo.connect</code> and can be loaded in 5.2KB minified, half the size of <code>dojo.connect</code>, and fires non-native events twice as fast.  The <code>dojo/on</code> module also includes new functionality for extension events, dispatching events, and providing a base class/mixin for adding event emitting functionality to classes. In addition, there is now a new <code>on()</code> method for <code>NodeLists</code> (the results of <code>dojo.query()</code>) based on the new event listening with event delegation.</p></blockquote>
