title: Over one million books read at Tar Heel Reader!
---
<p>Today at about noon we passed 1,000,000 books read on <a href="http://tarheelreader.org">Tar Heel Reader</a>.  I've embedded a video below showing how its use has spread over the 22 months since we began back in May 2008. If you have sound you should be able to hear a varying pitch indicating how many books were read each day. Listen for the pitch to go down during the summer and at Christmas.
