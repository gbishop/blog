title: Web-based games for kids who are VI
---
<p>I read a nice paper about a project of the Swedish Library of Talking Books about their Flash <a href="http://www.tpb.se/barnens_tpb/spel/projekt/report.html">games for kids</a> who are visually impaired. How about a version of Hark like this? Would Flash or Java-Script be more portable?</p>
