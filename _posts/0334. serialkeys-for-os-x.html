title: SerialKeys for OS X
---
<p><strong>This software is no long supported.  Anyone is free to attempt to make it work with the new versions of OS/X.</strong></p>

<p>SerialKeysX is an implementation of the <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/260517/EN-US/">SerialKeys</a> protocol for <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Apple's OS X operating system</a>. It allows control of the computer's keyboard and mouse over a serial connection from devices such as the <a href="http://www.eyegaze.com/">EyeGaze</a> and other <a href="http://www.abilityhub.com/aac/aac-devices.htm">augmented communication devices</a>. You may download and use the software for free.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Note that SerialKeysX has been tested with OS X 10.5. We believe it should also work with OS X 10.4 (Tiger). Please let us know if it works for you with some other configuration. We also believe we can build a version that works on OS X 10.3, let us know if you need it.</p>

<p>To use SerialKeysX you will need both a serial adapter and the SerialKeysX software. We have successfully used the software with the following adapters:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.keyspan.com/products/usa19hs/">KeySpan “High Speed” USB Serial Adapter such as model USA-19HS</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.iogear.com/main.php?loc=product&Item=GUC232A">IOGear GUC232A USB</a>.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>Installation</strong></p>

<p><ul>
	<li>Install the serial adapter and driver software.</li>
<ol>
	<li>Make sure the serial adapter is not connected to your computer.</li>
	<li>Follow the adapter instructions and install their driver software.</li>
	<li>Connect the serial adapter to your computer.</li>
</ol></p>
