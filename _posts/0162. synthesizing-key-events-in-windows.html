title: Synthesizing key events in windows
---
<p>For my video switch I want to be able to synthesize key events that look like they originated from the keyboard. The function SendInput in the user32.dll looks like the right low-level goods but Pete points out that the WScript.Shell has a SendKeys method that is easier to use. The Python code looks like:</p>
<pre>import win32com.client
ws_shell = win32com.client.Dispatch("WScript.Shell")
SendKeys = ws_shell.SendKeys</pre>
<p><a href="http://www.devguru.com/Technologies/wsh/quickref/wshshell_SendKeys.html">DevGuru</a> has a table of the key encodings.</p>
