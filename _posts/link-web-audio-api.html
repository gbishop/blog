<blockquote class="reader-clip">This specification describes a high-level JavaScript <acronym title="Application Programming Interface">API</acronym> for processing and synthesizing audio in web applications.  The primary paradigm
      is of an audio routing graph, where a number of <a href="http://chromium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/samples/audio/specification/specification.html#AudioNode-section"><code>AudioNode</code></a> objects are connected together to define the overall audio rendering.  The actual processing will primarily take place
      in the underlying implementation (typically optimized Assembly / C / C++ code), but <a href="http://chromium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/samples/audio/specification/specification.html#JavaScriptProcessing-section">direct JavaScript processing and synthesis</a> is also supported.</blockquote>
