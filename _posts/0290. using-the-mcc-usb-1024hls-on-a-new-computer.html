title: Using the MCC USB-1024HLS on a new computer
---
<p>The MCC USB-1024HLS Digital I/O box wants me to run their InstaCal software before I can use it from python. When installing it on a new computer, install <a href="ftp://ftp.measurementcomputing.com/downloads/InstaCal/icalsetup.exe">their drivers</a> and then run that program once.
