<p>My modification of a recipe from http://southernfood.about.com/od/dessertsaucerecipes/r/bl80503c.htm
<ul>
	<li>2 cups milk</li>
	<li>3 eggs, beaten</li>
	<li>1/3 cup sugar</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
	<li>3 slices homemade sourdough bread, cubed</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
	<li>1/3 cup coconut</li>
</ul>
Heat milk 3.5 minutes in microwave until hot, but not boiling.  In a bowl, combine  eggs, sugar, and salt; stir well.  Gradually add about 1/4 of the hot  milk to the egg mixture and stir in.  Add remaining milk, stirring  constantly. Stir in vanilla.</p>

<p>Place bread cubes in 2 quart baking dish sprayed with PAM. Mix coconut with bread. Pour the milk mixture over bread. Sprinkle cinnamon over pudding mixture. Bake, uncovered, at 300Â° for about 50 minutes, or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Serve warm with vanilla sauce or other dessert sauce, if desired. Serves 6.</p>
