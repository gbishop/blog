title: Cinnamon Raisin Scones
---
<p>My first attempt at scones. These are a bit too sweet and have a bit too much vanilla for my taste. The dough was very sticky, next time I should use less liquid.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.sunmaid.com/recipes/recipe/Cinnamon_raisin_scone.html">Sun-Maid Recipes</a></p>

<p><!--more--></p>

<p>2 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter or margarine
2/3 cup milk
1 beaten egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup Sun-Maid Natural Raisins</p>

<p>HEAT oven to 400 F (I used 375 convection)</p>

<p>COMBINE flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon and salt.</p>

<p>Using pastry blender or fork, CUT IN butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</p>

<p>COMBINE milk, egg and vanilla.</p>

<p>ADD to flour mixture; stir until dry ingredients are moistened.</p>

<p>STIR in raisins.</p>

<p>With floured hands, SHAPE dough into 8-inch round on ungreased cookie sheet.</p>

<p>SPRINKLE with additional sugar, if desired.</p>

<p>CUT dough into 8 wedges; slightly separate wedges.</p>

<p>BAKE at 400 F for 15 to 20 minutes. Serve warm. (17 minutes seemed right)</p>
