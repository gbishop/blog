title: Trekker Breeze Scavenger Hunt at Maze Day 2009
---
<p>Can We Find It? Yes We Can!</p>

<p>Come see if you can find "it" at <a href="/~gb/blog/2009/02/15/maze-day-2009/">Maze Day 2009</a> on the University of North Carolina Campus at Chapel Hill.  What are we looking for?  We'll be looking for bus stops, intersections, building entrances and much more.  Using Trekker Breeze, students, teachers, parents and peers will participate in a "Talking GPS" scavenger hunt on campus.  During the activity we will use the newest in GPS technology for the blind and visually impaired to find out "What's around."  Join us to learn about this exciting technology and be ready to have some fun in the process.
