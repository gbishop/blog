title: Upgraded to WordPress 2.3.1
---
<p>I used the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing/Updating_WordPress_with_Subversion">SVN approach</a> this time. Very simple to set up and it seemed to work fine. In the future I should just have to type 
</p>
<pre><code>
$ cd wp
$ svn sw http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/tags/2.3.1/
</code>
</pre>
<p>substituting the current version number for 2.3.1.</p>

<p>Please let me know if you see something broken.</p>
