title: Why I don't develop for the iPhone/iPod Touch
---
<p>The iPhone and iPod Touch are very interesting platforms for enabling technology. Touch, accelerometers, portability, radio, coolness; they've got it all. </p>

<p>But the rules of program distribution are so ridiculous that I can't imagine playing by them. I want to give my apps away. And I want to do it without some faceless technician's approval. </p>

<p>After you've done the work to develop your App they can reject it without giving any reason.</p>

<p>This recent post from <a href="http://www.riverturn.com/blog/?p=455">Riverturn</a> illustrates the problem though I've heard of many more cases like this.</p>
