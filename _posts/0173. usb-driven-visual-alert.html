title: USB-driven visual alert
---
<p>Shelley Tabakman of the <a href="http://dsdhh.dhhs.state.nc.us/">NC DHHS</a> asked about some sort of visual alert for hearing-impaired users of email and IM. They'd like to be notified of an incoming message by a signal visible when not looking at the screen. The <a href="http://www.smarthome.com/insteon/sdk2600U.html">INSTEON</a> developer kit looks like the right goods.
