title: Time to Adore
---
<p>I heard this in the publicity surrounding Ruth Graham's recent death. Wow. I really like the line "Anticipating joy is itself a joy".</p>

<p>And when I die I hope my soul ascends slowly
So that I may watch the earth receding out of sight
Its vastness growing smaller as I rise
Savoring its recession with delight
Anticipating joy is itself a joy
And joy unspeakable and full of glory
Needs more than in a twinkling of an eye
More than in a moment
Lord, who am I to disagree?
Itâ€™s only we have much to leave behind,
So much before.
These moments of transition will,
For me, be
Time to adore.</p>

<p>Ruth Graham</p>
