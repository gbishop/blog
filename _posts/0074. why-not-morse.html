title: Why not Morse?
---
<p>While listening to <a title="Bapin's home page" href="http://www.bapin.info/">Anindya Bhattacharyya (Bapin)</a> at "The Magic of Technology for the Deaf-Blind Population" workshop in Raleigh today I starting thinking again about Morse code. Bapin was lamenting the high cost of Braille displays. The problem, as with most assistive technology, is low volume. You can buy a great laptop for less than $1k but a Braille display to go with it is going to cost several thousand. He told about students they train at <a href="http://www.hknc.org/">Helen Keller National Center for the Deaf-Blind</a> having to wait for years to get the equipment they need.</p>

<p>Why not Morse code for display?
<ul>
	<li>Even completely deaf individuals could hold a commodity earphone plugged in to the headphone jack on a laptop; the user should easily feel the headphone vibrate. The speakers on many laptops likely produce enough vibration to be felt as well.</li>
	<li>Software could display on-screen text as Morse code. I think it would be easy to extend the free Linux Screen reader or to adapt JAWS or Window Eyes to display Morse much like they do Braille.</li>
	<li>With a little software, many cell phones could be used for text messaging by displaying the text in Morse on the built-in vibrator. This would allow deaf-blind individuals to communicate using cheap commodity phones.</li>
	<li>Lots of PDAs could be similarly adapted.</li>
	<li>Morse is easy to learn.</li>
	<li>Morse is reasonably fast. Old-time radio operators commonly transcribed Morse at 70 words per minute.</li>
	<li>Older adults with poor sensitivity in their finger tips have great difficulty reading Braille, but could easily feel the vibrations of Morse.</li>
	<li>Using the common stereo sound card we could place the vibrations for dots and dashes in different places which might make them easier to distinguish for beginners.</li>
	<li>Using a refreshable Braille display requires moving one hand back and forth between the display and the keyboard. With a speaker/vibrator placed on the back of the hand or wrist you could type with both hands while reading.</li>
</ul>
Refreshable Braille displays might well be faster than Morse and better in other ways but Morse is FREE! Its mighty hard to beat that price performance.</p>
