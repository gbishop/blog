<blockquote class="reader-clip"><p><a href="http://jsonselect.org/#tryit">json:select</a> offers a new query API that is to JSON as querySelector and friends are to CSS. The goals are:</p>
<ul>
<li>intuitive – JSONSelect is meant to feel like CSS, meaning a developers with an understanding of CSS can probably guess most of the syntax.
</li><li>expressive – As JSONSelect evolves, it will include more of the most popular constructs from the CSS spec and popular implementations (like sizzle). A successful result will be a good balance of simplicity and power.
</li><li>language independence – The project will avoid features which are unnecessarily tied to a particular implementation language.
</li><li>incremental adoption – JSONSelect features are broken in to conformance levels, to make it easier to build basic support and to allow incremental stabilization of the language.
</li><li>efficient – As many constructs of the language as possible will be able to be evaluated in a single document traversal. This allows for efficient stream filtering.</li></ul></blockquote>
