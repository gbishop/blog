<p>Wow! Pete sent me this pointer to <a href="http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/opengazer/">Opengazer</a>. I've wondered if this was possible but never found a student to work on it. Thanks to <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pz215/">Piotr Zieli≈Ñski</a> for developing it and making it open source. We'll have great fun with this in accessible applications for people with impaired movement.</p>
