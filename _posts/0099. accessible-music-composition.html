title: Accessible Music Composition
---
<p>I have the beginnings of a tool to convert humming to musical notes. A simple music composition system with speech driven and/or simple keyboard commands would be very popular. You hum a bit of a tune, choose an instrument to play it, loop that, and it becomes the background for the next track. Then you hum something over that, choose an instrument and youâ€™ve on your way to a brilliant composition.</p>
