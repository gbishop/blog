title: CoScripter and Accessibility
---
<p>Pete pointed me to <a href="http://services.alphaworks.ibm.com/coscripter/browse/about">CoScripter</a>, a tool from IBM intended to automate web processes. He and I have been talking for a while about "grass roots" accessibility in which end-users are enabled to easily make and share accessibility improvements for web sites. CoScripter looks like a step in that direction.</p>
