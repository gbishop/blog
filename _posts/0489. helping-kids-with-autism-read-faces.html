title: Helping kids with autism read faces
---
<p>Another neat idea from Karen. There have been some news stories about a <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99732203">DVD that helps kids with autism learn to read faces and emotions</a>. It would be cool to do a version which allows folks to upload their own pictures and which presents the faces in an interactive web site.</p>
