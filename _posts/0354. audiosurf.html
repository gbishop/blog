<p>Jonah sent a pointer to <a href="http://ve3d.ign.com/articles/reviews/36799/Audiosurf-Review">AudioSurf</a>, a new game that lets you "ride your music". </p>

<p><blockquote>Audiosurf is a music-adapting puzzle racer where you use your own music to create your own experience. The shape, the speed, and the mood of each ride is determined by the song you choose. You earn points for clustering together blocks of the same color on the highway, and compete with others on the internet for the high score on your favorite songs.</blockquote></p>

<p>It reminds me a bit of our, much simpler, <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/Courses/comp145-s04/BlindGames/index.html">SonicZoom</a>. I think people will really go for the hook of basing the track on the music. </p>

<p>How should an accessible version of this game work?
