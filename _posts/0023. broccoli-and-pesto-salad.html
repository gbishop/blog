<p>How about broccoli pesto used to make a salad with tortellini and vegetables?
<h3><span class="caps">INGREDIENTS</span>:</h3>

<h3><span class="caps">DIRECTIONS</span>:</h3>
Begin the pesto by placing an ample cup of cooked broccoli buds in a food processor.</p>

<p>Also add a garlic clove, 1/2 a cup of walnut meats, a third of a cup of fresh basil leaves, 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice, about a quarter cup of parmesan cheese, five grinds of black pepper and a half cup of olive oil. Blend it all up.</p>

<p>Next, cook up an 9 ounce package of cheese stuffed tortellini. When it’s done, drain the stuffed pasta shapes and add the pesto. Stir it up and cover it to allow the flavors to grow.</p>

<p>Next, drop in a cup of cooked, sliced carrots, a cup of cooked green beans and a half cup of quartered grape tomatoes. Stir it up, and it’s ready to serve.</p>
