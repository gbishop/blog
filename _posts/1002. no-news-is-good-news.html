<p>The more I cut back on broadcast news, the happier I become. I first started during the recent election season when the political ads were insane. Then I got fed up with the amateur hour over at <a href="http://www.wral.com">WRAL</a> and switched to listening to <a href="http://www.jazzwithbobparlocha.com/">Jazz with Bob Parlocha</a> on <a href="http://www.wncu.org/">WNCU</a> in the mornings. I took another step today by automatically muting <a href="http://152.9.6.199:1910/listen.pls">WNCU's stream</a> at the top of each hour when they play NPR news.</p>

<p>I get my news reading the <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/">paper</a> and the web where <b>I get to choose</b> what I read. According to a <a href="http://people-press.org/report/689/">recent Pew Research Report</a> this puts me in with the young hip consumers of news.</p>

<p>I recommend taking a break from the talking heads, you'll be happier for it.</p>

<p>If you're interested, here is the code I use to mute the news.</p>
