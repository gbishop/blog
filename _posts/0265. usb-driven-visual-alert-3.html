title: USB-driven visual alert
---
<p>I'm continuing to think about the <a href="/~gb/blog/2007/04/07/usb-driven-visual-alert-2/">usb visual alert</a> for people who are hearing impaired. Tonight I saw this <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/node/7353/print">article on writing a linux USB driver</a> and it points to this <a href="http://www.delcom-eng.com/">source of cool controllable LED lights</a>.</p>

<p>Looking a bit more reveals this <a href="http://www.gniibe.org/ac-power-by-usb/ac-power-control.html">post on how to control USB power</a>. With that we could use a really cheap USB lamp as the indicator.</p>
