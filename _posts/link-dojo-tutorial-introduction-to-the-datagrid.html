Next in our series of Dojo Tutorials, we have the first of three tutorials on the DataGrid!</p>
<h2>You asked. We listened. Let’s talk about the DataGrid.</h2>
<p>The DataGrid is the central component of many applications due to its effective and usable presentation of tabular data. In this tutorial we will look at how to define a grid’s layout and discuss the scrolling mechanism the DataGrid uses.</p>
