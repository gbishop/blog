<p>Some <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~gb/maps/">maps</a> Diane sent to help us think about text-based maps. She said:
<blockquote>I have faxed several maps to you. Eastern Alamance High School is a series of buildings connected by covered sidewalks. On my map, the buildings are shaded yellow. The section with X and circles (bushes) is the outside courtyard. There is a map of Northgate Mall (Durham). I have a poor map of GMS. The last map is a street map of the area around GMS. The numbers on this map correspond with restaurants (see last page).</blockquote></p>
