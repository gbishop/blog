<p>I haven't used <a href="/~gb/blog/2007/02/04/python-opencv-wrapper-using-ctypes/">CVtypes</a> recently so it hasn't gotten any of my (very limited) attention. I see that Minh-Tri Pham has forked a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ctypes-opencv/">version</a> that he is maintaining over at Google Code. I recommend folks use and support his version. Next time I need it, I'll probably adopt his.</p>
