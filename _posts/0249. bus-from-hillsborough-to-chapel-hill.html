title: Bus from Hillsborough to Chapel Hill

<p><p class="note">The schedule has changed with the new bigger buses provided by Chapel Hill, Transit. <a href="http://www.gotriangle.org/trip/en/?mm=timetables&sm=&key_1=420%3A1#results">Check the TTA site for the current schedule.</a></p></p>

<p>I've been riding the OPT/TTA bus (TTA route 420) from Hillsborough to Chapel Hill (and back) for about 20 months and I love it. The benefits include saving the environment, saving money on parking (more than $1000/year) and gas (about $1400/year), avoiding the bother of driving, and fellowship with a friendly community of people. The University kindly picks up the tab through the <a href="http://www.dps.unc.edu/dps/alternatives/commuter_alternatives_program.htm">Commuter Alternatives Program</a>. I'm blogging about it in hopes more people will learn about this poorly advertised service.</p>

<p><del datetime="2008-11-03T15:21:56+00:00">Here is the current schedule. TTA seems to know very little about this route. If you want to check on anything, call OPT (Orange Public Transportation) at 919-245-2008.</del></p>

<p><p class="note">The southbound 7:00am run and the northbound 5:10pm run are new in response to demand from people who have to work 8am to 5pm. </p></p>

<p>The fare, if you don't have a pass provided by the university, is $2.00 each way. The elderly or disabled pay half that.</p>

<p>I encourage folks who travel between Hillsborough and Chapel Hill to give this great service a try.
