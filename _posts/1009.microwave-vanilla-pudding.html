<p>Delicious and easy pudding based on a <a href="http://www.cooks.com/rec/view/0,1840,143167-238204,00.html">Easy Vanilla Pudding</a>. I rearranged the steps to minimize cleanup and provided a few variations.</p>

<ul>
	<li>1/4 cup cornstarch</li>
	<li>2/3 cup sugar</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
	<li>2 cups milk</li>
	<li>2 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
	<li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
</ul>

<p>Put cornstarch, sugar, and salt in a glass 2 quart bowl (I used the 2 quart measure). Measure 1/2 cup cold milk using the glass 2 cup measure and mix into the dry ingredients until well blended.</p>

<p>Heat 1 1/2 cups milk in 2 cup measure on high until heated through but not boiling (3 minutes in my microwave). Gradually whisk in hot milk into the cornstarch mixture until no lumps remain.</p>

<p>Cook in microwave until mixture is thickened and glossy. Mine took about 2.5 minutes stirring at 1 minute intervals.</p>

<p>Beat the eggs in the same 2 cup measure and gradually add half of the hot mixture. Return the egg mixture to the remaining hot mixture.</p>

<p>Cook on high for about 3 minutes or until the pudding begins to boil. (less than 3 minutes for me)</p>

<p>Stir in the butter and vanilla.</p>

<p>Pour into 4 custard cups. Refrigerate.</p>

<p><b>For Coconut Creme Pudding</b></p>

<p>Stir in 2/3 cup sweetened coconut with the butter and vanilla. I think I cut back to 1/2 cup of sugar.</p>

<p><b>For Banana Creme Pudding</b></p>

<p>Cut 2 bananas into small pieces and stir in with the butter and vanilla. I put a vanilla wafer in the bottom and stood 5 around the perimeter of the custard cups before pouring in the pudding. It made 5 custard cups this way.</p>
