title: Sample-based 3D Audio
---
<p>I have just begun to investigate the possibility of doing for 3D audio what image-based rendering does for computer graphics. I have an 8-microphone array and can record sound simultaneously at up to 96kHz with 24 bits per sample. Iâ€™d like to process the recorded sound to produce the parameters of a random process that produces sound with similar spatial and temporal statistics.</p>
