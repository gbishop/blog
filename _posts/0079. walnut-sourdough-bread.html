title: Walnut Sourdough Bread
---
<p>This is my modification of the recipe found at <a href="http://www.sourdoughhome.com/walnutbread.html">Sourdough Home</a>.</p>

<p>Makes 1 loaf.
<ul>
	<li>1 cup walnut pieces toasted 7 minutes at 325 convection stir once</li>
	<li>1 cup sourdough starter</li>
	<li>9 ounces water</li>
	<li>1 cup whole wheat flour</li>
	<li>2 cups bread flour</li>
	<li>1 tsp salt</li>
	<li>2 tsp yeast</li>
</ul>
Put 3/8 cup of the toasted walnuts into a food processor with 1 TBSP of whole wheat flour.  					Pulse the nuts and flour in the processor until they are finely ground.</p>

<p>Put all ingredients into mixer bowl with bread hook. Mix 1 minute on 1 and then 5 minutes on 2.</p>

<p>The dough was a bit sticky. Perhaps another tablespoon of flour?</p>

<p>Remove the dough from the mixer bowl, oil the bowl and return the dough. Allow to rise until double, about 40 minutes at 100 degrees.</p>

<p>Punch down, shape, put in a loaf pan. Allow to rise. Bake at 325 convection for 40 minutes.</p>
