<p class="reader-comment">Seems to me this service has great potential for kids with learning disabilities. Might enable a sort of skimming for blind people as well. </p>

<blockquote class="reader-clip">Using semantic text extraction and personalization technologies, Topicmarks extracts text from the .pdf, .doc, .html and .txt documents that you upload, copy/paste, email in or enter the URL of. The service then gives you the option to view the “Overview,”&quot;Facts,”&quot;Summary” and”Keywords” of the document as well as “Properties” where you can see the original source. You can also interact with the “Overview” in a multitude of ways, including searching by key word and adding more or less text to the summary as needed.</blockquote>
