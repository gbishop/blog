title: Talking Word Processor
---
<p>Talking with Karen and Gretchen they suggested a talking word processor with the following features.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Runs in the browser</li>
	<li>Allows switch, keyboard, and Braille input</li>
	<li>Provides customizable feedback on each input with speech, sounds, and pictures. For example on G it might suggest Gretchen as the child's intention or on the first letter of their name might suggest their name.</li>
	<li>Has a web-based back end that allows customization if the responses.</li>
	<li>Reads words or groups of letters on space or other customizable event.</li>
	<li>Models for a teacher/parent the kind of responses that might be appropriate.</li>
	<li>Possibly include a 20 questions sort of after writing interview aid (or is that a separate tool).</li>
	<li>Record what the kid writes and allow it to be published as print, email, web, etc.</li>
	<li>Record data.</li>
</ol>

<p>Possibly build on the ideas from <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/Research/assist/et/2005/WebTyper.html">WebTyper</a>. Maybe Flash would be an appropriate for implementation.</p>
