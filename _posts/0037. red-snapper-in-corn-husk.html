title: Red Snapper in Corn Husk
---
<p>Nothing ends a lazy summer day better than a light and healthy dinner
featuring fish. Wrapping this fish in a corn husk seals in the flavor
and creates a very cool presentation.</p>

<p>For the Fish:
<ul>
	<li>4 Red Snapper filets</li>
	<li>Salt and pepper</li>
	<li>White Wine</li>
	<li>4 Thyme Sprigs (optional)</li>
	<li>Butter</li>
	<li>4 corn husks (removed from 4 cobs)</li>
</ul>
For the Salsa:
<ul>
	<li>Corn kernels (removed from 4 cobs)</li>
	<li>2 avocados, peeled/diced</li>
	<li>3 tomatoes, diced</li>
	<li>2 Tablespoons olive oil</li>
	<li>1 Tablespoon diced jalapeno or chopped jarred green chilies</li>
	<li>Juice of 2 limes</li>
	<li>2 Tablespoons cilantro, chopped</li>
	<li>Salt and pepper</li>
</ul>
Slice husks down cob without piercing through corn. Remove cob from
husk and place husk on parchment paper.  Season skinless filets with
salt and pepper.  Place filets inside husks.  Splash a Tablespoon of
white wine onto each filet.  Top with a thyme sprig and a dollop.
Roll the sides of the husks up to cover and fasten with thin strips of
husk.  Place in a 400 degree oven for about 20 minutes.  To Make
Salsa:</p>

<p>Heat a saute pan with olive oil. Add corn kernels, tomatoes, jalapeno,
and the lime juice.  When corn mixture is heated through, remove from
heat and add diced avocado and chopped cilantro.  Remove Snapper from
oven and transfer to serving plate.  Open center of husk to reveal
fish (like a baked potato), and top with corn relish</p>
