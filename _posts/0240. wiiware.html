<p>Michael pointed me to <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=14485">announcements of WiiWare</a>, a new facility from Nitendo allowing small developers (like us) to develop and distribute games for the Wii. I think the Wii will make a wonderful platform for accessible games.</p>
