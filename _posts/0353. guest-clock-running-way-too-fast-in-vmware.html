title: Guest clock running way too fast in VMware
---
<p>I just noticed that the clock on my guest Windows XP system was running way too fast on my host Ubuntu Gutsy system. I had also noticed that double clicking seemed really difficult and there were a few anomalies with sound.</p>

<p>A bit of Googling turned up <a href="http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=1591">this tip from the VMware knowledge base</a>. So to fix things I added these lines to the bottom of /etc/vmware/config.</p>
<pre>
host.cpukHz = 3060000
host.noTSC = TRUE
ptsc.noTSC = TRUE
</pre>
<p>Now the clock and lots of other things are better.</p>
