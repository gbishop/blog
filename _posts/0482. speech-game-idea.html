<p>Michael sent email saying</p>

<p><blockquote>My friend Michelle's son Alex is autistic. We visited them on Saturday night.  While Michelle and the rest of us were doing whatever, Alex was playing with an R2D2 toy.</p>

<p>This toy performs actions based on speech recognition.</p>

<p>Alex: "Hey R2"
R2: affirmative beep (sounds like "Boo-Boop")
Alex: "Do yamgine?"
R2: negative beep (sounds like "Bee-Bawp")
Alex: "Do you 'magine?"
R2: negative beep
Michelle: "Do you remember?"
R2: affirmative beep
Michelle: "Darth Vader?"
R2: scared noise and shaking head and moving in circles (sounds like "wa-a-a-hoo!")</p>

<p>REPEAT w/o michelle for like an hour</p>

<p>the kid was HIGHLY motivated to say the right stuff, and kept at it.</p>

<p>what if there was a web framework (through flash or silverlight?) and a teacher could program in like the vocab, and a storyline (maybe somehting like tarheel reader could help create some default storylines (TANGENT: we should try to have some of your projects seed other as possible) and then the kid tries to say it, this would be for kids with speech issues.</p>

<p>maybe the kid's a detective, and has to go around quesitoning people, maybe at first it acknowledges bits and pieces (i.e."Hey <someone>" <ACK> "where were you?"<ACK> "<VOCAB like yesterday>?") then later it only acknowledges at the end</p>

<p>maybe how tolerant it is of sound deviating depends on the kid's level and their recent success rate...</blockquote></p>

<p>I love it! This could make a very interesting student project and would take our work in a different and exciting direction.
