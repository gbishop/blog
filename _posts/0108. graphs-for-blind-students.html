title: Graphs for blind students
---
<p>The most frequent request I get from teachers of the visually impaired is help with graphs. Graphs are a part of the curriculum that blind kids donâ€™t get. I contend that simply displaying the graph with touch or sound is not the answer. What is? Could we (semi)automatically extract key points from a graph and convey that information to a student?</p>
