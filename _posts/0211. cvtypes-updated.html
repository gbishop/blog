<p>I modified my former post <a href="/~gb/blog/2007/02/04/python-opencv-wrapper-using-ctypes/">Python OpenCV wrapper using ctypes</a> to reflect the new version available on SourceForge. This update includes lots of constants from the .h files (thanks to Russell Warren) and a simple hack to make it work on with the differently named DLLs on Linux. The source is now in <a href="http://uncpythontools.cvs.sourceforge.net/uncpythontools/CV/">CVS at SourceForge</a>.</p>
