title: The motors work great with the USB-1024HLS!
---
<p>The tiny pager motors (<a href="http://www.solarbotics.com/products/index.php?search_id=1056">VPM2</a> from Solarbotics) work great with the USB-1024HLS. I can drive them with the 15mA source capacity of the USB-1024HLS. Using duty-cycle modulation I can control the strength of the vibration. The 4-wire cable I used for each set of 3 is too stiff allowing vibration to couple from one to the next. I'm going to switch to long flexible pairs stripped from a flat cable. That should allow more freedom in placement and less coupling.</p>
