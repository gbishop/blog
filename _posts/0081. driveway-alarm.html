<p>Dakota Alert WPT-3000</p>

<p>We're very pleased with it. No false alarms, no misses either. We no longer need a doorbell. </p>

<p>Installed 31 July 2006. Batteries appear to last about 9 months. </p>

<p>Replaced east side battery on 26 January 2007 because of battery defect.
Replaced both batteries on 7 May 2007. Alarm was still working but sounds twice for a single car when the battery is weak.
Replaced east side battery on 2 Feb 2008, was sounding twice.</p>
