<p>Dakota Alert WPT-3000</p>

<p>We're very pleased with it. No false alarms, no misses either. We no longer need a doorbell. </p>

<p>Installed 31 July 2006. Batteries appear to last about 9 months. </p>

<p>Replaced east side battery on 26 January 2007 because of battery defect.
Replaced both batteries on 7 May 2007. Alarm was still working but sounds twice for a single car when the battery is weak.
Replaced east side battery on 2 Feb 2008, was sounding twice.</p>

<p>In November of 2009, one of our units started randomly sounding at odd times. I contacted the company and was instructed to send it back. They returned a new one, at no charge! This is after nearly 5 years of service. What a great company!</p>
