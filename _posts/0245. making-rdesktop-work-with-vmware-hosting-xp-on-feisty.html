title: Making rdesktop work with VMware hosting XP on Feisty
---
<p>Here is what I had to do to get rdesktop to connect to XP Professional installed on VMware Workstation 6 running on Feisty.</p>

<p>In the guest XP system added a password for my account and turned on Remote Desktop in the System control panel applet on the Remote tab.</p>

<p>I edited <code>/etc/vmware/vmnet8/nat/nat.conf</code> and added the line</p>

<p><code>3389 = 192.168.72.128:3389</code></p>

<p>in the <code>[incomingtcp]</code> section.</p>

<p>Then I edited <code>/etc/systl.conf</code> to change the IPv4 forwarding line:</p>

<p><code># Uncomment the next line to enable packet forwarding for IPv4
net.ipv4.conf.default.forwarding=1</code></p>

<p>Then I rebooted.</p>

<p>Now I started VMware and activated the guest XP system. Now the command:</p>

<p><code>rdesktop localhost</code></p>

<p>Works as expected.</p>
