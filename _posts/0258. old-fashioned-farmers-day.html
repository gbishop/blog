<p>This weekend in Silk Hope NC. Good country fun, good food, and lots of fascinating old machinery. Check out <a href="http://blog.borngeek.com/2007/08/30/farmers-day-2007/">Jonah's post</a> for more info.</p>

<p>Update: Check out <a href="http://blog.borngeek.com/2007/09/03/farmers-day-photo-album/">Jonah's photos</a>, he got some great ones this year. I particularly like the videos. </p>
