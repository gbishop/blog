title: Programming for kids?
---
<p>I want 10 year old game programmers working on games for kids with disabilities (and themselves). Given some tools, kids could write simple games that kids who have NO GAMES would enjoy. And maybe get drawn to CS at the same time. </p>

<p>It should work like <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a> but be much simpler. Everything should work in the browser and when you're done you should get a URL to share that runs your game. </p>

<p>We could have web site where kids could publish their games. </p>

<p>What should the language be? <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>? Why isn't it in the browser? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_%28programming_language%29">Logo</a>? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic">qbasic</a>?</p>

<p>I'm looking for ideas and pointers here.
