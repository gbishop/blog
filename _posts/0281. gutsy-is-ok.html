title: Gutsy is OK
---
<p>My previous <a href="/~gb/blog/2007/10/25/too-many-bugs-in-gutsy-back-to-feisty/">despair</a> faded and I'm giving Gutsy another try. Configuring my disks so that I have two partitions available for OS installs made it easy to try things as I got the chance. </p>

<p>I finally found a combination of settings that appear to make my displays work and don't kill gnome-terminal. I'll attach my <a href='/~gb/media/2007/10/xorg-conf.txt' title='xorg.conf'>xorg.conf</a> here in case I forget what it took.</p>

<p>Sound volume is markedly lower than under Feisty. But I simply turned up the volume on my speakers. </p>

<p>I went back through my old <a href="/~gb/blog/category/ubuntu/">Ubuntu</a> posts and redid the things that seemed applicable. Hopefully my update won't be too much trouble for Murray.</p>
