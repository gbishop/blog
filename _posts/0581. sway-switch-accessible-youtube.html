title: 'SWAY: Switch Accessible YouTube'
---
<p>My friend and source of ideas for interesting projects, Karen Erickson, suggested that kids love watching <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> videos but they aren't readily accessible to switch users. Couldn't we make an accessible version, she asked?</p>

<p>I presented this opportunity to Greg K., my latest intern from the <a href="http://www.ncssm.edu/">NC School of Science and Math</a>, a residential magnet high-school for students from around the state with aptitude and interest in science and math. In only a few weeks, Greg taught himself Javascript and the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/overview.html">YouTube API</a> and has a working prototype. </p>

<p>Check out his work at <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~gb/AccessibleYouTube/">http://www.cs.unc.edu/~gb/AccessibleYouTube/</a>.</p>

<p>This is just a prototype, and we are eager to get your <a href="mailto:sway-comments@cs.unc.edu">feedback</a> on what other features it needs. Right now you can choose and play videos from a YouTube playlist entered into a form.</p>

<p>Features we hope to support soon include:
<ul>
	<li>Browsing YouTube categories and related videos.</li>
	<li>Creating your own playlist</li>
	<li>Emailing video links to friends</li>
</ul></p>

<p>What else should we include?</p>
