title: Access to my Ubuntu files from Windows
---
<p>For some if my Windows testing VMware, sadly, won't do the job. For example, I can't get my USB webcam's to work on an XP guest running on VMware on my Ubuntu machine. For testing these things I have to use my laptop. Unfortunately that requires copying files over. So I wanted to share my Ubuntu files with my laptop. </p>

<p>It took a while and I tried many things but I think this is the combination that did the trick.</p>

<p>In Synaptic, install samba.</p>

<p>At the command prompt, run
</p>
<pre>
 sudo smbpasswd -a <em>yourid</em>
</pre>
<p>
give it your password and the password you want to use from the windows machine.</p>

<p>Now on the windows machine you should be able to connect. You may need to use the numeric IP address of the host.
