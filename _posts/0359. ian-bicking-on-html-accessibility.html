title: Ian Bicking on HTML Accessibility
---
<p>Ian Bicking's interesting and provocative blog post on <a href="http://blog.ianbicking.org/2008/03/23/html-accessibility/">HTML Accessibility</a> is a good read. <em>Empirical accessibility</em> is a good idea. I think by this he means making it work for real users. Fred Brooks' ideas about the <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~brooks/Toolsmith-CACM.pdf">computer scientist as toolsmith</a> seem very relevant.</p>

<p>I've been thinking about <em>grass-roots accessibility</em> for a while, though I can't say I've made much progress. It seems to me we have to somehow empower people to enhance accessibility in a bottom up way without much help from developers.</p>
