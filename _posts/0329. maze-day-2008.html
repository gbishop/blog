title: Maze Day 2008
---
<p>Maze Day is for visually impaired and blind students in grades K-12, their parents and teachers. Your students will enjoy fun and educational computer applications developed especially for them. UNC students will learn how well their accessible applications work with real users. And everyone will have a good time!</p>

	<li>Guitar Hero made accessible.</li>
	<li>Life size and computer mazes.</li>
	<li>Carolina Rocker: A rocking-horse (or therapy ball) game that combines exercise and acoustic localization.</li>
	<li>Carolina Beat: An accessible version of Dance Dance Revolution for a good exercise workout to music.</li>
	<li>Virtual Beep Ball.</li>
	<li>Sweet Beat: an edible drum sequencer.</li>
	<li>A new kind of Braille display.</li>
	<li>SamiSays: a program for recording stories with sound effects.</li>
