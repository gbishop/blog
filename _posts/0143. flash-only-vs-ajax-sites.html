title: Flash-only vs. AJAX sites
---
<p>Useful <a href="http://friendlybit.com/js/flash-only-vs-ajax-sites">comparison of Flash to AJAX</a>. No consideration of sound for which Flash appears superior. Talking about web sites rather than our application orientation. Not having to fool with browser differences could be a Flash advantage too. Still, he makes good points that resonate with me. Lots to consider.</p>
