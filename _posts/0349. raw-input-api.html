---
<p>Meg pointed out the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms645536.aspx">Raw Input API</a> for Windows. This would allow us to distinguish among multiple mice and keyboards. It might be interesting to use multiple numeric keyboards as specialized input devices, or multiple mice to provide 2 or 3 switches per hand.</p>
