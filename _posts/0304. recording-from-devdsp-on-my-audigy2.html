title: Recording from /dev/dsp on my Audigy2
---
<p>I couldn't get sound input to work. Output works fine but the microphone input on my Audigy2 card returned silence. After lots of Googling I found <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=2681937&postcount=7">this post</a> on Ubuntu forums. Indeed using alsamixer to adjust Master, Mic, and Analog Mix did the trick.</p>
