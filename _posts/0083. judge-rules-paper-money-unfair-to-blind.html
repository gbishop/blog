title: Judge rules paper money unfair to blind
---
<p>NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- A federal judge has ruled that the U.S. Treasury Department is violating the law by failing to design and issue currency that is readily distinguishable to blind and visually impaired people.</p>

<p>Judge James Robertson, in a ruling on a suit by the American Council of the Blind, ordered the Treasury to devise a method to tell bills apart.</p>

<p>The judge wrote that the current configuration of paper money violates the Rehabilitation Act's guarantee of "meaningful access."</p>

<p>"It can no longer be successfully argued that a blind person has 'meaningful access' to currency if she cannot accurately identify paper money without assistance," Robertson wrote in his ruling.</p>

<p>He further ruled that finding a solution to the problem would not be an "undue burden" on the government and ordered the Treasury Department to begin working on a solution within 30 days.</p>

<p>The American Council for the Blind has submitted several alternatives, including embossing, holes punched in the paper or using different-sized bills for different denominations.</p>

<p>The Treasury Department had no comment on the ruling.</p>
