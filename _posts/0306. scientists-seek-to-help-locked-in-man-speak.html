title: Scientists seek to help locked-in man speak

<p>Greg pointed me to this article over at CNN about <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/conditions/12/14/locked.in/index.html">Erik Ramsey and the work Phil Kennedy is doing with neural mapping</a>. Very interesting work. The article mentions The Diving Bell and the Butterfly by Jean-Dominque Bauby; I've read that book and highly recommend it.</p>
