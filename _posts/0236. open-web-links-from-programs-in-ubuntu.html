title: Open web links from programs in Ubuntu
---
<p>In both Python and VMware I've noticed that attempts to open a link in the browser failed with a very strange <code>file:// link</code> containing double quote characters. A bit of searching revealed this is a problem with the calling syntax from Firefox in System -> Preferences -> Preferred Applications. Changing from "Custom" to "Firefox" so the Command is <code>firefox %s</code> fixes things nicely.</p>
