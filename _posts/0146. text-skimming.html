<p>Skimming in text for people who are blind or reading help for people with learning disabilities. Automatic summarization or maybe Cliff Notes merged with a book so that you can read at the summary level or down at the detailed level. How can students who are blind skim for answers to questions? Can this help people with learning disabilities? Sort of <em>Tell what youâ€™re going to tell them, tell them, and tell them what you told them</em>.</p>
