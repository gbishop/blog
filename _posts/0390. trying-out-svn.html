title: Trying out SVN
---
<p>I really ought to use source code control. I know it. But my laziness combined with my poor memory, makes it hard.</p>

<p>I'm trying out subversion. I'll make some notes here to help me remember.</p>

<p>To create a new project myproject in my repository I need to:
</p>
<pre>
cd ~/Desktop
mkdir myproject
cd myproject
mkdir trunk tags branches
cp -r path_to_myproject_files/* trunk/
clean up any junk files
svn import ~/Desktop/myproject svn+ssh://gb@cvs.cs.unc.edu/cvs/user/gb/svn/myproject -m "initial import"
cd place_to_work
mv path_to_myproject_files out of the way if necessary
svn checkout svn+ssh://gb@cvs.cs.unc.edu/cvs/user/gb/svn/myproject/trunk myproject
</pre>
<p>Then in that working directory the commands to know are: <code>svn add</code>, <code>svn update</code>, and <code>svn commit</code>.
</p>
