title: Making jslint work on Ubuntu Lucid
---
<p>They dropped spidermonkey from Ubuntu with the Lucid release. This broke my jslint script. </p>

<p>Tons of searching revealed that some of the Launchpad folks had done the necessary incantations to make it work.  I did:</p>

<p><code>
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:launchpad/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install spidermonkey-bin
</code></p>

<p>On the way I found this nice python wrapper for jslint to replace the perl one I had found. Check out <a href="http://github.com/FND/jslint-cli">jslint-cli</a>.</p>
