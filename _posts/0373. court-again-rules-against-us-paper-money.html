title: Court again rules against US paper money
---
<p><a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hncgd98TAVGQgYJCdjKTuPZOD-fA">A US federal appeals court on Tuesday ruled that the country's one-sized paper money discriminates against the blind and told the government to change the currency's size and texture.</a> It's taken six years to get this far, and the government may well appeal again. I say give it up and switch to an accessible design.</p>
