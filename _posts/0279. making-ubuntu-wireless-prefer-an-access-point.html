title: Making Ubuntu Wireless Prefer an Access Point
---
<p>I've been annoyed for months by my laptop selecting my neighbor's access point over mine. On every startup I'd have to make sure I was using our network. I looked a few times but apparently with the wrong search terms. The answer is to use <a href="https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/12327">gconf-editor as described here</a>. One point that momentarily fooled me, you do <strong>not</strong> want to use sudo for this.</p>
