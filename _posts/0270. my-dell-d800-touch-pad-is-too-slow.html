title: My Dell D800 Touch Pad is Too Slow
---
<p>This D800 has the 1920 by 1280 screen and the touchpad defaults are way too slow. I looked for a tool to adjust it but don't see one. I edited xorg.conf to look like this:</p>

<p><code>
Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier      "Synaptics Touchpad"
        Driver          "synaptics"
        Option          "SendCoreEvents"        "true"
        Option          "Device"                "/dev/psaux"
        Option          "Protocol"              "auto-dev"
        Option          "HorizEdgeScroll"       "0"
        Option          "MinSpeed"              "0.75"
        Option          "AccelFactor"           "0.50"
        Option          "SHMConfig"             "true"
EndSection
