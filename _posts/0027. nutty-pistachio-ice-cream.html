<p><ul>
	<li>1 cup half-and-half</li>
	<li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
	<li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
	<li>2 egg yolks, beaten</li>

	<li>1 tablespoon finely grated orange peel</li>
</ul>
Heat half-and-half in saucepan; stir in sugar and salt.
Pour a small amount of hot half-and-half into egg yolks, stirring constantly.
Return yolk mixture to half-and-half; cook and stir over medium heat about 5 to 10 minutes or until thickened and creamy. Do not boil. Cool. Stir in vanilla and heavy cream. Chill.
Pour into freezer container; follow manufacturerâ€™s directions for freezing.
Add pistachios and orange peel when almost frozen; freeze until firm.
Allow ice cream to stand at least 2 hours in refrigerator-freezer to mellow flavors.
<h4>Blanching Process:</h4>
Drop shelled nuts into boiling water, remove from heat and let them soak for about one minute.
Drain and rub the pistachios with a clean kitchen towel.
To dry, spread on a large baking sheet in an oven preheated to 300 degrees F. for 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
