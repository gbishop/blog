title: Disable balloon tips in Thunderbird
---
<p>I've started using Lightning for my calendar and I really like it except for the stupid balloon tips that pop up and get stuck every time my mouse passes over the Thunderbird window, even when it is below another window. I turned them off with Edit->Preferences->Advanced Tab->Config Editor... and setting browser.chrome.toolbar_tips to false. Much better now.</p>
