<p>Pumped 21 October 2006 by J.C. Johnson Septic Service. He says it looks good. Suggested adding copper sulfate to discourage the tree roots. This <a href="http://www.fcs.uga.edu/pubs/current/C819-3.html">web page</a> at the University of Georgia supports adding copper sulfate and suggests 2 pounds per 300 gallons no more than 2 times per year. He says maple trees are the worst.</p>

<p>Plan to pump again in 2009.</p>
