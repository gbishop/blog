<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="/~gb/blog/2008/01/22/maze-day-2008/">Maze Day 2008</a> will be April 30, 2008.</p>

<p><strong>Maze Day has been postponed until Spring 2008.</strong> Many school districts are unable to come on December 6th so we're going to postpone the activity until late Spring 2008 (around the time we've held it before). We apologize to those (few) of you who have already committed to coming.</p>

<p>Maze Day is for visually impaired students in grades K-12, parents and teachers to enjoy fun and educational computer applications. Lunch will be provided. <strong>Free!</strong></p>

<p>Registration is limited to the first 70 students.</p>
