title: Hark the Sound Statistics
---
<p>Diane asked, so I decided to process our server logs to find out how many times our game for children who are blind and visually impaired, <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/Research/assist/Hark3/">Hark the Sound</a>, has been downloaded and, if possible, the country that requested it. </p>

<p>The quick summary is that Hark the Sound has been downloaded by 1537 unique IP addresses, we have mailed 169 CDs to the US and 9 to other countries, and we have given away over 500 at workshops. We encourage people to make their own copies so we must be approaching 3000 installed versions in the field.</p>

<p>Identifying the geographic location associated with an IP address is a shaky proposition but I decided to try anyway. I used the database at <a href="http://www.hostip.info/">Hostip.info</a> to extract the following stats.</p>

<p>Hark has been downloaded by IP addresses in 70 countries and 46 US States. The countries I can identify include:</p>
