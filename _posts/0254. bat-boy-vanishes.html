<p>A really enjoyable <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/105/story/683078.html">story about the demise of the Weekly World News</a> that I read in the N&O today. <em>I'm pig-biting mad!</em> I only read the cover while waiting in line at the grocery store but I remember laughing out loud at the clever headlines they'd have. So much better than the celebrity crap I see now...</p>
