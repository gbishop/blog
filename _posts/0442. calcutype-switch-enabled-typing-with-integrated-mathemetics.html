title: 'CalcuType: Switch-enabled typing with integrated mathematics'
---
<p>This is a follow up to my post about <a href="/~gb/blog/2007/12/02/accessible-math-ideas/">Accessible Math Ideas</a> from over a year ago. I finally got a smart high school student, William Condon from the NC School of Science and Math, to implement word prediction with built-in math.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://wwwx.cs.unc.edu/~gb/calcutype/">CalcuType</a> online and let us know what you think. </p>

<p>You can type using the virtual keyboard, the standard keyboard, or a mouse. The "mover" and "chooser" keys are adjustable and William included a 3rd "completer" key for quick access to completions. However you're typing the program will suggest completions much like many other available tools. The key difference is when you type a mathematical expression it will suggest the answer as a completion. So if you type (3+5)*2 it will suggest =16. It handles complicated mathematical expressions including square root and trig functions. </p>

<p>One other neat feature William implemented is the ability to write on a worksheet represented as an HTML form. </p>

<p>It still needs work but we're at the stage where we need feedback from users who need such a tool.</p>
