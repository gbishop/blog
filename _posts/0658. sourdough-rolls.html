<p>Make the <a href="/~gb/blog/2008/01/31/sourdough-white-bread/">Sourdough White Bread</a> recipe, divide into 15 balls and place in a lightly oiled 9x13 glass pan. Let rise, then bake at 375 for 15 minutes, brush tops with melted butter, then cook for 5 minutes more. Thanks to <a href="http://sourdoughdiva.blogspot.com/2009/04/sourdough-dinner-rolls.html">Sourdough Diva</a> for the idea.</p>
