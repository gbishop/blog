title: Donate Platelets

<p>I've been a platelet donor for the Red Cross for years but driving over to Durham to donate is a bother (can't ride the bus so I have to drive to work that day but then parking around here is awful). So I'm going to give the program here on campus a try. </p>

<p>Their web page is impossible to find, so I'm blogging about it so that I can find it in the future. Go to the <a href="http://www.unchealthcare.org/site/healthpatientcare/deptscenterspgms/platelets">UNC Health Care Platelet Donor Program</a> page.</p>
