title: Desensitizing kids with autism to stressful experiences with VR
---
<p>Karen suggests it might be useful to develop VR scenarios to help kids become accustomed to normally stressful audio over stimulation without the added social burden of having to deal with people at the same time. For example, many kids can't go to the movie theater because the THX sound thing at the beginning overwhelms them.  If they could experience that THX sound in a controlled environment with gradually increasing volume it might not be so bad when it happened at the theater. </p>

<p>Lots of other situations could be handled similarly.</p>
