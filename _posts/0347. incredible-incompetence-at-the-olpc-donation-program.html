title: Incredible incompetence at the OLPC donation program
---
<p>I was excited about potential for the XO as a delivery vehicle for assistive technology. The laptop looks great online so I ordered one through the buy one get one program. I figured we'd get to develop a demonstration on it for Maze Day. Boy am I disappointed...</p>

<p>I made my donation on 14 November expecting the laptop by Christmas.</p>

<p>I got a thank you note from Nicholas on 16 November.</p>

<p>I got an email on  22 December promising delivery by 15 January. </p>

<p>I got email on 19 January saying their shipment system could not ship to my address. We get shipments here on campus every day from every shipper. I responded that their shipment system is broken and they should drop it in US Mail. Their email included a 24 hour dedicated 800 number for speaking to an agent.</p>

<p>I got email on 21 January apologizing for the email of the 19th, saying ignore the request for updated shipping information.</p>

<p>I got email on 25 January saying it had been sent to the warehouse for shipping.</p>

<p>I got email on 6 February telling my how grateful they were for the overwhelming response.</p>

<p>On 14 February I called the 800 number. The lady who answered the phone "hello?" didn't appear to know anything about the OLPC. I figured I had the wrong number so I apologized, hung up, and dialed again. Same lady, except this time after much silence she gave me another 800 number to call. </p>

<p>I called it, got a menu, chose to speak to a person, and was informed that my XO would ship "at the end of March".</p>

<p>Yow. These guys are going to change the world? My confidence is waning. </p>
