title: Connecting a Dojo Data Grid to a JsonRestStore
---
<p>I looked high and low and couldn't find a working example of connecting a <a href="http://docs.dojocampus.org/dojox/grid/DataGrid">dojox.grid.DataGrid</a> to a <a href="http://docs.dojocampus.org/dojox/data/JsonRestStore">dojox.data.JsonRestStore</a> so I puzzled out parts of it myself. This code probably has errors and omissions but it seems to work for me with dojo 1.4.1. </p>

<p>I would appreciate any corrections or pointers to other examples from those of you who know better. I haven't included any error checking and the references to items by key break down after deletions because of the simple minded implementation of the "database".

I wrote the little server using <a href="http://www.tornadoweb.org/">tornado</a> but I'm not using any special features of that package. </p>
