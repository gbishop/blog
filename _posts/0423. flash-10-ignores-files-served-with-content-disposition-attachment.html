<p>I got a report that <a href="http://tarheelreader.org">Tar Heel Reader</a> wasn't speaking on some newer computers. Thankfully it also didn't work on my Vista VM. I painfully tracked down the problem to the <code>Content-Disposition: attachment</code> header I had added to make debugging easier. After figuring out the problem I found this <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/fplayer10_security_changes_02.html#head32">Adobe info describing the change</a>.</p>
