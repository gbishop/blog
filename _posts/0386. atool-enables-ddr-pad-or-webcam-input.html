title: atool enables DDR pad or webcam input
---
<p>Atool is an extension to our previous <a href="/~gb/blog/2007/11/18/camkeys-is-a-simple-camera-based-alternative-keyboard/">CamKeys</a> project. Like CamKeys, atool allows keyboard input based on a cheap webcam. Atool adds DDR pads (or other game controller buttons) as an additional input and it allows playing recorded sounds on input events.

My teacher friends in the Progress Education Program over at Asheville wanted to experiment with alternative computer interfaces in their classrooms for kids with multiple disabilities. I demonstrated MusicPad (a simple DDR pad driven sound player) and CamKeys to them. They were excited by the possibilities but daunted by editing files to control it all and depending on keyboard focus to get events to the right places. </p>

<p>So I hacked on CamKeys to add a GUI for configuring all sorts of events. I'll include a few screen shots below. Now the teachers are recording their own speech and music sounds and hooking them to events on the DDR pad or camera.</p>

<p>The CamKeys roots of this project were funded by the Mozilla foundation.</p>
