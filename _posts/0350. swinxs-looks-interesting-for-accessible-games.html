title: Swinxs looks interesting for accessible games
---
<p>Engadget has an article on <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/02/18/swinxs-lures-your-children-outside-tricks-them-into-moving-aro/">Swinxs</a>, a new game platform introduced at Toy Fair 2008. Its the size of a small drink cooler and comes with RFID bracelets the kids wear. It apparently has some lights and audio output. The included games encourage running around and include stories as well. The part that intrigues me is the promise of an SDK and the ability to develop and share games. Perhaps we could develop some accessible games for kids with various disabilities.</p>
