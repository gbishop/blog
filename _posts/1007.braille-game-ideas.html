<p>I think I see how to make the 
<abbrev title="Dance-Dance-Revolution">DDR</abbrev> pad work with 
this new generation of browser-based games so I'm thinking about a successor to Braille
Twister. I don't know if we'll have it ready for Maze Day but we'll
see. I'd like your feedback on the concept.</p>

<p>The game will start with some possibly changeable setup like <em>The
animals have escaped from the zoo! Help rescue them by making the first
letter of their names.</em></p>

<p>It might then play the sound of a monkey and say, <em>Rescue the monkey
by making the first letter of the word monkey. Can you make that
letter?</em></p>

<p>Now the child has to make the letter M. If they make another letter,
for example B, the game would say, <em>You made a B, that would make
B-O-N-K-E-Y, bonkey</em> (the text-to-speech would say the word). <em>You
must make the letter M to spell M-O-N-K-E-Y, monkey. Make the letter M.</em></p>

<p>If the kid misses again it could say the letter M is dots 1, 3, and 4,
Press dots 1, 3, and 4. When the kids gets it right, it would say,
<em>That's right! M-O-N-K-E-Y spells monkey.</em> and they'd hear the monkey
sound again.</p>

<p>Then it might say, <em>You've rescued the monkey, now let's rescue the
bear.</em> and repeat.</p>

<p>This game could be played with the DDR pad *OR* with the six-key
embosser like input on the keyboard. It would be the same game, just
different style input.</p>

<p>You might even play a different version with the conventional
keyboard. It might work a bit like the Braille input in that you get
to hear what key you are pressing with a "preview voice" before you
make the selection so a child could fumble around finding the key. We could
start with words on the home keys.</p>

<p>Other variations of the same game might have vocabulary words and no
special sounds. Maybe the teacher could enter the words with a blank
where they want the child to enter the letter. So it could be first
letter, or any other, depending on the lesson goal. Diane suggests we
look up the list of "sight words" for elementary students and include those
in an example.</p>

<p>Other story lines might include: barn-yard animals, machines, and foods.</p>

<p>My goal is getting kids making letters <b>AND</b> thinking about words at
the same time.</p>
