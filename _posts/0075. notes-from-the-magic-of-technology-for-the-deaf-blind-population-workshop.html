title: Notes from "The Magic of Technology for the Deaf-Blind Population" Workshop
---
<p>Bapin talked about not being able to students while they are wearing "FM" headsets. Why not run the audio through the computer using the microphone in?</p>

<p>What can we do to help adults (esp. seniors) learn Braille? Is there a game format that would motivate?</p>

<p>What kind of info-technology jobs could we imagine for the deaf-blind?</p>

<p><a href="/~gb/blog/2006/11/14/why-not-morse/">Why not Morse code? </a></p>

<p>Is it nuts to try to port LSR to windows?</p>

<p>How do we control the reading cursor one letter at a time?</p>

<p>How can we make giant magnification easier to use? Scanning? Automatic movement from letter to letter? Pack more information into the screen?</p>

<p>Is there a free-ware screen magnifier?</p>
